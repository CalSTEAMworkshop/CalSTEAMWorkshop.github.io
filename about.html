                <img src="Sudisha.jpg" alt="Sudisha" width="360" height="300">

                <p>Sudisha Kumar is a 13 year old who lives in the Bay Area. She is the current Founder of the STEAM Workshop.</p>
                <p>Her interests include storytelling, reading, thinking about life, poetry, sleeping and daydreaming, trolling, spreading meaningful messages with art, and coding (especially web designing!) She also likes reading scary stories, like articles about the future which are written by paranoid authors :) Qualifications:</p>
                <ul class="a">
                    <li>Kennedy Middle School's Speech Captain</li>
                    <li>Got artwork published in John Hopkin's CTY Lexophilia Journal</li>
                    <li>She won a Certificate for Computer Science from MIT Edx</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Sudisha strongly felt like STEM was missing an important aspect, one that would expand innovation and creativity in young students. Wanting to make an impact in kid's educational learning, she found and researched more about STEAM, an engaging learning approach which involved Art in a STEM curriculum. Sudisha decided to start this STEAM Workshop so that she could encourage kids to think outside the box with the aid of Art. </p>
