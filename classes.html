                <p>There are many ways to combine STEM and art. However, at times it might be difficult to find activities with easy scripting since at times it can be tricky due to format. This is why CalSTEAMworkshop has been able to find activities that are engaging and fun while enforcing logical and critical thinking. </p>

                <br>
                <p>One great example is Scratch Programming. It is a block-based visual programming language that enforces many computer science principles. It is usually targeted for young kids to develop their logical thinking skills. However, in our class, since there is no scripting format needed and just blocks, we will be teaching more advanced computer science principles in our Scratch Programming Workshop. Kids will learn the basic process of debugging as well as trial and error, to get a more solid foundation of programming using modern languages like Python and Java.</p>
                <p>Another example of a STEAM activity/program is Web Designing. In another one of our classes, we will teach students how to create a website using code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). This course is one of the more advanced ones that require scripting and format in order for it to run smoothly. Therefore, our Web Design package will be divided into 3 sessions for kids to join. If our Web Designing classes are in demand, we will host a Web Designing 4 class that teaches basic JavaScript.</p>

                <h3>Class Requirements</h3>

                <p>Our STEAM Workshop Sessions plan to be held COMPLETELY VIRTUALLY on Zoom, an easy, online video communication platform. On the platform, we ask that our participants' cameras are ON and their mics stay MUTED unless they need to speak. If the participant's camera doesn't work, please let the particiapnt's parents email us.</p>
                <p>If a participant misses on a class, they may contact the teacher for the material they missed.</p>
